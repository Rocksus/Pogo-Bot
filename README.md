# Pogo, a personal chat assistant for LINE

Pogo is a chatbot designed in a microservice oriented way to enable additional features to be implemented in without bloating the main app.
Currently pogo is set to run independently by each user.

## Usage

1. Copy `.env.example` into your own `.env` file. Fill up the environment variables according to their respective usages.
2. Set up a webhook (ngrok works fine if you want to test locally)
3. Run it, and start chatting with your bot!
